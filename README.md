# BIO722_Final_Project

The markdown file contains all of my code and my writeup. However, the "Link to HTML knit from markdown" might be easier to read. I was not sure whether you would be able to see all of the images I included in the markdown file given how the directories I reference are local. I've also included folders that contain the outputs of different quality assesment measures, but those are largely for interest. I included relevant examples in the main text.

My references are also in a separate document.
